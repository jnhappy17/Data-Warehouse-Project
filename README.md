# Data-Warehouse-Project
**Building a data warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server**

Welcome!
This project highlights industry best practices for Data Engineering through the creation of a data warehousing and analytics solution using Microsoft SQL Server.

## Specifications
**Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
**Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
